**For advanced users** it is possible to create your own commands but you need to know the topic of the information/action to be linked.

To know these topics, put the plugin log in "Debug" mode, restart the daemon and read the content of the "MqttRing" file. You can also connect directly to the MQTT broker.

- **Stream URL**: rtsp://localhost:8554/**<camera_id>**_live (Replace **<camera_id>** with your camera ID)
